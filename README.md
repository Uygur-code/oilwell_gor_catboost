# GOR (gas/oil ratio) calculation from oil well production testing where GOR measurements are scarce.
Here we utilized catboost machine learning regression (catboost.ai) to calculate the GOR and the catboost regressor is optimized using Optuna.
The results optained are satisfactory, and future work will focus on using Confromal Prediction to evaluate uncertainty.
